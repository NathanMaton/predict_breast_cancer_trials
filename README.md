## Predicting Clinical Trial Success & Time to Market

Developing a drug costs $2.6 billion on average. Our project uses ML & predictive analytics to
predict both whether a drug will make it through clinical trials and how long it will take. The
first drug to market often does better than the next with an average of 12% more revenue per year.

We used data from ADIS and partnered with [GlobalReach BI](http://www.globalreachbi.com/en/home/), experts in health industry market research.
